# Wrap upðŸŽ‰
- We implemented a type-1 fuzzing hypervisor
- We learned
  - how hypervisor sets up and starts a guest, and handles events from it
  - how hypervisor virtualizes physical memory for the guest
  - how hypervisor can inspect guest's behaviour to track execution coverage and catch possible bugs
