# Nested paging structure entries
- Comparable to the traditional paging structure entries
  - bit[11:0] = flags including page permissions
  - bit[N:12] = either a PA of the next nested paging structure, or a page frame to translate to
- Intel: Similar to traditional paging structure entries but different
