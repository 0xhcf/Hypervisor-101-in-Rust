- UEFI is a pre-OS environment, aka, BIOS
- In our execution phase (called "DXE") is:
  - single threaded; no thread or process
  - ring-0 and long-mode
  - single flat address space
- Why
  - Less waste of system resources
  - OS agnostic deigns and dev environment
  - No need to worry about compatibility with OS
  - Easy to access hardware features
  - Well documented API
  - Why would we need an OS?
