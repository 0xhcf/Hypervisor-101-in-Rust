# Exercise preparation: Code annotations and solutions
- All exercises can be found by searching `E#` under the `hypervisor` directory.
  - One exercise may require updates in multiple locations. For example, `E#1-1` and `E#1-2` are a single exercise, and you must complete both to observe an expected result.
  - Some exercises are in both `vmx.rs` and `svm.rs` files. Based on your preference of the platform, you can chose one and ignore the other in this case.
- A solution of each exercise will be pushed to the github repo as a commit.
